# School-Projects
This repository contains some of the projects that I have completed as part of my coursework.

### Budget Breakdown Program
My Budget Breakdown Program is one of my school projects I'm most proud of. I completed this project as an honors option for my software engineering class. It uses microsoft visual studio to create a GUI that allows a user to create a graphical representation of their spending/income for a certain month. The user has the option to add transactions, which can either be a purchase or a paycheck. They can then enter in the amount of that transaction and select the month to which it belongs. The user also has the option to display a particular month. When they choose the display option, a pie graph is shown depicting their spending by category that month. In addition, their total paychecks, purchases, and net cash flow are displayed to the side of the graph. The user also has the ability to save the information of a particular budget session using xml files. This means that if they complete their data entry for April they can save it a pull it up later for reference, or if they want to be able to save the whole year has one file, they can continuously edit one session over time by saving an opening the same one.

### R Shiny Job Search App
I created this small app as part of my introduction to data science course. Using a set of data about data science jobs, it allows a user to search for jobs either by location or date posted. It displays a map denoting where certain positions are located, as well as the details of the job position (under the Postings tab).

### Encoded Message Project
This was a project for my introduction to C++ class in which we were given instructions on how an encrypted message would be passed in. We then had to come up with the code to decode the message and then encode a message in the same style.

### Matrix Manipulation Project
This program was part of my introduction to C++ class. It includes different functions that manipulate 2D matrices.

### Document Reading Project
This project was designed to read in a text document and perform some simple text anlaysis functions.

### AVL Tree Project
This project was part of my data structures and algorithms class. The Node class, AVL Tree constructor, equal and comparison functions were provided by the instructor. My job as a student, was to complete the insert, remove, search, inorder, preorder, postorder, breadth_first, depth, height, min, max, left_rotate, right_rotate, rebalance, and sum_update methods (I wrote some helper functions as well). This project allowed me to gain an understanding of AVL and balanced trees and the operations required to search/add/remove/traverse them.

### Hash Table Project
Another project from my data structures and algorithms class, this assignment helped me gain an understanding of hash tables and the methods used to store data into them while minimizing conflicts. This particular project focused on double hashing.
