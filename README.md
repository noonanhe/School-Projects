# School-Projects
This repository contains some of the projects that I have completed as part of my coursework.

### Encoded Message Project
This was a project for my introduction to C++ class in which we were given instructions on how an encrypted message would be passed in. We then had to come up with the code to decode the message and then encode a message in the same style.

### Matrix Manipulation Project
This program was part of my introduction to C++ class. It includes different functions that manipulate 2D matrices.

### Document Reading Project
This project was designed to read in a text document and perform some simple text anlaysis functions.

### AVL Tree Project
This project was part of my data structures and algorithms class. The Node class, AVL Tree constructor, equal and comparison functions were provided by the instructor. My job as a student, was to complete the insert, remove, search, inorder, preorder, postorder, breadth_first, depth, height, min, max, left_rotate, right_rotate, rebalance, and sum_update methods (I wrote some helper functions as well). This project allowed me to gain an understanding of AVL and balanced trees and the operations required to search/add/remove/traverse them.

### Hash Table Project
Another project from my data structures and algorithms class, this assignment helped me gain an understanding of hash tables and the methods used to store data into them while minimizing conflicts. This particular project focused on double hashing.
